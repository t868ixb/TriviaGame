This little program allows you to answer some questions and at the end know how many you got right, wrong, or didn't answer.

for the html side I used a bootstrap layout.  One row and three columns was my choice.  I tried to put most (I got close) of my logic in the js file.  I created the buttons on the html to be able to get this done on time. 

I tried to use the .each method but was not successful.  Instead I did a for loop to be able to finish this.
